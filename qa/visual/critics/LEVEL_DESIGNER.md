# Level designer

**Role ID:** `LEVEL_DESIGNER`

## Focus

Route legibility, player choice, recovery, route anticipation, landmarking and transition clarity.

## Required semantic response for every inspected frame

Can a player read the immediate next action, fallback and destination from this camera angle? Identify misleading routes, blind commitment and framing changes.

Populate every required field in `../review_contract.schema.json` from the image itself:

1. What is visible?
2. What looks bad?
3. What signals a placeholder?
4. What is repetitive?
5. What is unconvincing?
6. Is this a visual dead zone (empty sky/wall/floor, black void, irrelevant geometry or HUD-dominated), and why?
7. What is missing?
8. What should be replaced?
9. What should be moved?
10. What should be added?
11. What should be removed?

Use `NEEDS_FIX` when the image has any material weakness, rather than silently
passing it. `APPROVED` is allowed only after the current capture/revision—not a
previous score—meets the documented 7.5 category / 8.5 overall / no-critical gate.
